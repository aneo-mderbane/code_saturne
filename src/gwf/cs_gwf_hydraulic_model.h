 * O. Angelini, C. Chavant, E. Ch√©nier, R. Eymard and S. Granet in Mathematics
 * and Computers in Simulation (2011), 81 (10), pp. 2001--2017
 *
 * Main assumptions are:
 *   - No water in the gaseous phase
 *   - Incompressibility of the liquid phase
 *   - Hydrogen pressure is given by the "perfect gas" law in the gas phase and
 *     the Henry's law in the liquid phase (when a miscible model is used)
 * The two primitive variables are the capillarity and liquid pressures with a
 * specific treatment in the saturated case (cf. the cited article or
 * Angelini's PhD thesis)
 *
 * Notations are the following :
 * - Two phases: Liquid phase denoted by "l" and gaseous phase denoted by "g"
 * - indice "c" refers to the capillarity pressure
 * - Two components: water denoted by "w" and a gaseous component (let's say
 *   hydrogen) denoted by "h". The gaseous component is present in the two
 *   phases whereas water is only considered in the liquid phase.

   *      can be weigthed by a relative (scalar-valued) permeability. In the
   *      simplest case (saturated soil) the relative permeability is useless
   *      since this is equal to 1 (no weigth).
